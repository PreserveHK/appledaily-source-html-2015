The king's inept, autocratic rule worsened matters, and widespread crop failures led to famine.<br>On  14 July  1789, thousands of Parisians took to the streets, marching to the Bastille, a medieval fort where Louis XVI imprisoned his enemies. The people stormed the fort, and almost in an instant were in possession of a fortification, defended by  100 men, of infinite strength.<br>When Louis XVI at Versailles received the news of the capture of the Bastille, he exclaimed, "Why, this is a revolt!" "No, sire," replied the news-bearer, "it is a revolution."<br>一七七四年，路易十六登上法國王位，其政府當時債臺高築，其人民則苦於糧食價格有升無已，勞工待遇刻薄，以及貴族、僧侶肆意壓迫。而路易十六既無能，又獨裁，使情況更加惡劣。此外，農作物普遍失收，處處饑荒。<br>一七八九年七月十四日，數以千計巴黎市民上街，走到巴士底監獄。那是一座中世紀堡壘，路易十六用以囚禁仇敵，建築非常堅固，有一百人把守，但幾乎轉眼就給那些巴黎市民攻陷。<br>路易十六在凡爾賽宮接到巴士底陷落的消息，失聲說：「啊，這是造反！」傳信者回答：「陛下，這不是造反，而是革命。」</p></body></html>
