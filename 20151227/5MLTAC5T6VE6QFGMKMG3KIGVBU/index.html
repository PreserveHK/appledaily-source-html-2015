Harvey Klemmer, a good friend to Britain in the country's darkest hour, was one of them. He tells of how a London warden, a slim, elderly man, responded to an air raid.<br>While this man was working on a job, someone came running to tell him his own house, a few streets away, had been destroyed. His wife and children, fortunately, had gone to a nearby shelter. I asked the man what he would do if he could lay his hands on the airman who had dropped the bomb. He gulped a couple of times and I waited eagerly to hear what sort of punishment he would be prepared to mete out. "Well," he said slowly, "I don't think I would give him a cup of tea."<br>德軍大舉空襲英國期間，不少美國人身在倫敦，見英國人英勇不屈，會向其國人述說，哈唯．克萊默就是這樣一位美國人，也是英國在最艱苦時候的一位好朋友。他談到倫敦一個瘦削年長的空襲防護員，遇上空襲的反應。<br>這防護員正在工作，有人跑來告訴他說，他自己的房子給炸毀了。那棟房子距離他當時所在的地方，不過幾條街。幸而他的妻子兒女事先去了附近一個防空洞。我問他說，假如抓到投炸彈的飛行員，會怎麼辦。他吞吞口水。我靜待一旁，很想知道他準備怎樣懲處那飛行員，只聽見他緩緩說道：「我不會請他喝茶。」</p></body></html>
