For this purpose he repaired to Paris, where he thought fit to stay instead of joining Napoleon upon his journey to Elba.<br>When Napoleon triumphantly returned to Paris in 1815 without shedding a drop of blood, Roustan imagined that with his benefactor's reinstatement to power, he was in like manner to resume his former employments at the palace. When it was told to Napoleon that Roustan had presented himself for that purpose at the Tuileries, Napoleon issued his command that in case he did not instantly retire, he would be flogged for his intrusion. Such was the only punishment inflicted by Napoleon for the basest ingratitude. A solemn assertion frequently uttered by Napoleon was that he had never revenged himself for a personal injury during the whole course of his life.<br>一八一四年拿破崙遜位，馬穆魯克人魯斯唐*本應隨他流亡。拿破崙給他三萬法郎，作他離家期間妻子兒女的生活費。他回到巴黎安頓家庭，但抵家之後，卻決定留下來，不隨拿破崙赴厄爾巴島。<br>一八一五年，拿破崙兵不血刃，奏凱回到巴黎。魯斯唐以為恩公既然重新掌權，他從前在王宮的職務也會恢復。拿破崙聽到魯斯唐來到杜伊勒利宮，謀求復職，就下令說，他不馬上離去，將問擅闖宮禁罪，處以笞刑。拿破崙對最卑鄙的忘恩負義者，懲罰不過如此。他多次嚴肅表示，一生之中，從未因私怨報復。<br>*魯斯唐原任拿破崙保鏢，甚得恩遇。</p></body></html>
