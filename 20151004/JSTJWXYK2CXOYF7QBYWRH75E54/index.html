After the clergyman had concluded his remarks, Lincoln asked if any others desired to add anything to what had already been said. They replied they did not.<br>Then looking as serious as he could Lincoln said:  "Doctor, can you tell me where General Grant gets his liquor?"<br>The doctor seemed quite nonplussed, but replied that he could not.<br>Lincoln then said to him:  "I am very sorry, for if you could tell me I would direct the chief quartermaster of the army to lay in a large stock of the same kind of liquor, and would also direct him to furnish a supply to some of my other generals who have never yet won a victory."<br>美國南北戰爭期間，林肯總統之下，統帥北軍的，是攸里西斯．格蘭特將軍。他有貪杯的惡名，不少人都向林肯批評他沈酗於酒。<br>有一天，紐約一個代表團，由一著名神學博士率領，往謁林肯，同樣向林肯表示不滿格蘭特續任軍隊統帥。林肯待那教士說罷，問其他人對格蘭特還有什麼批評，大家都說沒有。<br>林肯於是裝出非常認真的樣子，問道：「博士，你知不知道，格蘭特的酒從那裏買來？」<br>那神學博士似乎大為錯愕，回答說不知道。<br>林肯就對他說：「這真可惜。假如你知道，我會叫總軍需官多儲存那種酒，並叫他送一些給從未打過勝仗的將領。」</p></body></html>
