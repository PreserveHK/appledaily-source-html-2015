Of all the family of the Bourbons, the Duke and Duchess of Angouleme alone persisted in the struggle against Napoleon. When the Duke surrendered, Napoleon spared his life by allowing him to be conducted to Spain.<br>Meanwhile, the duchess, who was at Bordeaux, made the city's national guard take up arms. She also went to the barracks to speak to the soldiers, striving to awaken feelings for the royal cause, and demanding whether they would unite with the national guard in defence of Bordeaux. The reply she received was as follows:  "We will obey our leaders in everything related to the country's safety, but we will not have a civil war, nor will we fight against our brothers." The duchess, realising that her cause was lost, finally had to leave the country. Napoleon, when told of her courage, said,  "She is the only man in the Bourbon family."<br>一八一五年三月，拿破崙逃離厄爾巴島，回到法國，路易十八和家人、朝臣一起，棄國而去。波旁王族之中，只有安古萊姆公爵和他夫人繼續抵抗拿破崙。安古萊姆公爵後來投降，拿破崙饒他一命，放他去西班牙。<br>同時，安古萊姆公爵夫人在波爾多市，教該市國民衞隊執戈抗敵。她又去軍營，向士兵致辭，力勸他們效忠王室，問他們會不會和國民衞隊攜手保衞波爾多。她得到的答覆是：「凡關乎國家安全事宜，我們唯領袖之命是聽。不過，我們不會內戰，也不會骨肉相殘。」公爵夫人知道努力已是徒然，終於也離開法國。拿破崙後來聽到她這麼勇敢，說道：「她是波旁王族之中，唯一的男兒。」</p></body></html>
