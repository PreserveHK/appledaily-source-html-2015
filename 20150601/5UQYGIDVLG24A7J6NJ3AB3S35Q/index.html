Napoleon pronounced him the king of Rome. A few days later, a widow, whose only son was drawn to serve in the conscription, presented herself at the Tuileries, saying that she had a petition, and was ushered into Napoleon's presence. She fell upon her knees and requested that she might be conducted to the young king of Rome.<br>Napoleon, somewhat astonished at the singularity of this request, took the paper, which upon perusal was found to contain a prayer that her son might be exempted from the effects of the conscription laws. Smiling, Napoleon approached the cradle of his son, and read in a low voice the contents of the petition. Then, after pausing a while, he said,  "Madame, I have read your petition to the king. As there is no answer, silence of course implies consent."<br>一八一一年三月二十日，拿破崙的兒子在杜伊勒利宮出世，拿破崙宣布冊封他為羅馬王。幾天之後，有獨子被徵召入伍的一個寡婦，來到杜伊勒利宮，說要上書陳情，獲帶到拿破崙跟前。她跪下，要求見年幼的羅馬王。<br>拿破崙聽到這奇怪的要求，有點愕然，取過陳情書，見是請求免卻那寡婦的兒子按徵兵法服役。拿破崙面帶微笑，走到他兒子的搖籃前，低聲把陳情書讀出，稍待片刻，然後說：「夫人，我給羅馬王讀了你的陳情書，他沒有回答，而沈默當然等於同意。」</p></body></html>
