On Napoleon's being informed of the fact at Lyons, he sent for Fournier, and addressed him as follows:  "M Fournier, the first time the adventurer landed on these shores it was to dethrone anarchy,* and this time he has landed only to dethrone despotism. He beholds with pleasure the learned and enlightened M Fournier, who accompanied General Bonaparte to Egypt; and he feels that he cannot better avenge himself for the proclamations of the prefect of Isere, or better testify his affection for the Lyonnese, than in calling the worthy and virtuous man to perform the functions of the prefect of Rhone."<br>一八一五年三月，拿破崙逃離厄爾巴島。他在法國弗雷瑞斯登陸的時候，伊澤爾省長富尼耶接連發表幾篇文告，呼籲民眾驅逐「再度登陸弗雷瑞斯的那個亡命叛徒」。<br>拿破崙國王所向披靡，富尼耶唯有望風而逃，逃到里昂藏身。拿破崙來到里昂，聽說富尼耶身在當地，就把他召來，說道：「富尼耶先生，那亡命之徒第一次登陸弗雷瑞斯，是要平息無政府的亂狀*；這一次，則是要廢除獨裁統治。現在，他見到富尼耶先生，十分高興，因為這個人識見不凡，並曾隨拿破崙將軍征埃及。那亡命之徒認為，要報復伊澤爾省長發表文告之恨，要證明他對里昂人的情意，最好的辦法，是委任德高望重的富尼耶先生為羅納省長。」<br>*一七九九年，拿破崙從埃及回國，保衛執政團政府（the Directory），當時也是在弗雷瑞斯登陸。</p></body></html>
