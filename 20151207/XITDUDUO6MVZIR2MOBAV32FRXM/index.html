Seeking to keep the occupants of the town under control, an officer of the German army called all the citizens to the town hall and insisted that they all take the oath of allegiance to the German Emperor.<br>One particularly truculent and obstinate inhabitant refused to be intimidated, and kept boasting of the brave defence the Belgians put up against the superior German force. Finally, the German officer lost all patience, and said,  "Take this oath of allegiance or you'll be shot!"<br>Faced with this alternative, the man gave in and took the oath.<br>"That's the spirit," said the German,  "now you may come and go as you please. You are one of us."<br>With a sly grin on his face, the Belgian turned and said,  "Say, didn't those Belgians give us a hell of a fight?"<br>第一次世界大戰期間，德軍進佔比利時一個小鎮。一德國軍官有心教鎮民服從，叫他們齊集鎮公所，宣誓效忠德國國君。<br>一個鎮民非常固執不馴，不受恐嚇，不斷誇言比利時人怎樣以弱敵強，勇抗德軍。最後，那德國軍官失卻耐性，說道：「你不宣誓，就要槍斃！」<br>那人別無選擇，只得屈服，宣誓效忠。<br>那德國軍官說：「這樣的態度就對了。現在，你已成為我們一分子，可以來去自如。」<br>那比利時人露出狡獪笑容，轉身說道：「哎，那些比利時人，和我們對敵，不是頑強得很嗎？」</p></body></html>
