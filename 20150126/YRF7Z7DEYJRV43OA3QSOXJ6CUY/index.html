They had no money, and many sold their horses and other property to sustain life. Some actually died of want.<br>At the sale of some effects of a deceased officer after Salamanca, the man who officiated as auctioneer on that occasion, on producing a prayer book as the next lot for competition, remarked that  "he must indeed be a brave man who purchased it, as that was the fourth time during a month he had submitted it for sale."<br>拿破崙戰爭的薩拉曼卡戰役之後，最初兩三天，英軍士兵乏糧，困苦不堪，低級軍官的困苦更甚，煎熬時間也更長。他們沒有錢，不少得把馬匹及其他財物變賣，以免餓死。有些更在匱乏之中死亡。<br>那場戰役之後，一個軍官去世，遺物給拍賣，擔任拍賣者的那個人，拿出一本祈禱書，準備供下一輪競投。他說「買這本書的人，一定十分勇敢，因為這是他一個月之內第四次拿出來拍賣」。<br>*Lot是拍賣場中每次供競投的一件或一批物品，例如：The antique clock is listed in the catalogue as lot number  3（拍賣目錄上，那古董鐘的拍賣編號是三）。</p></body></html>
