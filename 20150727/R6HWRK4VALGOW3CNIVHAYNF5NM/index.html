Still it was necessary to establish outposts. A grenadier, stationed upon this service, fell fast asleep.<br>Napoleon, who offered up his own repose, proceeded, alone, to visit the outskirts of the camp, and arrived at the spot where lay the sleeping sentinel. Napoleon took up his musket and mounted guard for nearly an hour. The grenadier at length awoke and, by the light of the moon, perceived the general.  "O! I am undone!" he cried.<br>"No, my friend," replied Napoleon with extreme affability.  "The battle was long enough contested to excuse your having yielded to the impulse of fatigue. I have only to advise that you would be more upon your guard for the future."<br>拿破崙將軍率領的法軍，在義大利一場戰役大敗奧地利軍之後，疲憊不堪，不過，仍須設立前哨站。一個擲彈兵，奉命站崗，卻沉沉睡去。<br>拿破崙自己不休息，單獨一人，走到軍營周圍巡視，來到那沉睡哨兵所在，拿起那哨兵的火槍，守望將近一小時。最後，那哨兵醒過來，月光之下，見到拿破崙，失聲叫道：「我完蛋了！」<br>拿破崙態度非常和藹，回答說：「不用擔心，老兄。這場戰役，爭持太久，怪不得你抵不住倦意。我只是要告訴你，以後可得小心一點。」</p></body></html>
