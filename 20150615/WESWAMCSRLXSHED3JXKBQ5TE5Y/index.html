They asked him, in vain, to join their youthful sports. "Playing and dancing," he replied, "is not the way to form a man."<br>*　　　　　*　　　　　*<br>On the day of Napoleon's coronation, Carayon Nisas, the tribute, was asked by the emperor, "How did the republicans seem to be affected by the ceremony of the day?"  "They are in raptures, sire," said the flatterer, bowing low, "and are felicitating themselves on the auspicious event."
