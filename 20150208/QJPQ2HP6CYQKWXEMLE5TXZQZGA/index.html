In order to save Ney's life, his lawyer declared that Ney was now a Prussian and could not be judged by a French court as Ney's hometown of Sarrelouis had been annexed by Prussia. Ney ruined his lawyer's efforts by interrupting him and saying,  "I am French and I will remain French."<br>In December 1815, Ney was executed by firing squad in Paris. He refused to wear a blindfold and was allowed the right to give the order to fire. He said,  "Soldiers, when I give the command to fire, fire straight at my heart. Wait for the order. It will be my last order to you. I protest against my condemnation. I have fought a hundred battles for France, and not one against her. Soldiers, fire!"<br>米歇爾．內伊是拿破崙帝國最先委任的十八位元帥之一，拿破崙稱他為「勇者中之最勇者」。<br>滑鐵盧戰役之後，內伊被波旁王朝拘捕，並以叛國罪名審訊。律師想救他性命，就說內伊的故鄉薩爾路易已遭普魯士吞併，所以內伊已成為普魯士人，法國法庭無權鞫審。但是，律師的努力為內伊所壞。內伊打斷他的辯詞，插嘴說：「我是法國人，今天如是，永遠如是。」<br>一八一五年十二月，內伊在巴黎遭行刑隊槍決。他不肯蒙上眼睛，並獲准頒發「開槍」的命令。他說：「各位士兵，我一下開槍命令，就瞄準我心臟開槍，準備聽令吧。這是我給各位的最後命令了。當局對我的判決並不公平。我曾為法國百戰沙場，卻從來沒有一次倒戈犯法國。各位士兵，現在開槍吧！」</p></body></html>
