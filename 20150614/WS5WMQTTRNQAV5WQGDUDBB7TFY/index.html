Conceiving on this occasion that he had an excellent hold on the minister of the interior, Fouche, he expressed himself pretty roundly ① on the subject.<br>To this Fouche archly replied,  "Sire, that street was left in darkness by my express order, as I did not wish that the citizens of your capital should become acquainted with the circumstance of your paying nightly visits to a certain hotel therein situated."<br>As the emperor had a little  <em> affaire d'amour</em>  ② in that quarter, which was known to Fouche, notwithstanding Napoleon's precaution to the contrary, the latter, on receiving this reply, was very glad to hold his tongue.<br>拿破崙對其大臣的作為，十分注意，有一次，聽到巴黎有一條街晚上照明甚差，深感不快：他特別着重「美好巴黎」的照明。拿破崙認為，內政大臣富歇這過失是無可推託的了，就嚴詞相責。<br>富歇一臉狡獪神情，回答說：「陛下，是我特別下令這條街不要照明的。我不想巴黎市民知道，你每晚都去當地一家旅館。」<br>拿破崙雖然力求不為人知，但富歇還是知道，國王在當地有段風流事。拿破崙一聽到這回答，就連忙噤口。<br>① Round可解作「不容情」或「不客氣」，例如：He criticised me in good round terms（他毫不客氣的批評我）。<br>② <em> Affaire d'amour</em> 是法文，英文常見借用，等於love affair（風流事）。</p></body></html>
