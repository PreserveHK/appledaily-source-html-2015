One of his first objects was to cause to be effaced all the busts and statues of his illustrious predecessor. However, on the return of Napoleon in 1815, it was discovered that, in the palace of the Louvre, the bust of Napoleon was very happily transformed into the bust of Louis XVIII by the addition of a wig of the plaster of Paris.<br>* 　　　　* 　　　　*<br>In 1820, the emperor of Austria visited his Lombardo Venetian dominions. He went to the opera in Venice, with Marie Louise, the widow of Napoleon. The audience were clamorous in their applause, and so particular in directing it to the ex-empress, that, as the best way of appeasing the tumult, Marie Louise quitted the theatre. The audience, however, rose with her, and accompanied her home, leaving the emperor of Austria in a most humiliating position.<br>一八一四年拿破崙放逐厄爾巴島之後，路易十八登上法國王位。他首先要做的，是盡除前朝這個傑出國王的半身及全身雕像。可是，一八一五年拿破崙回到法國，大家才發現，在羅浮宮，工匠用石膏給拿破崙半身像加上假髮，就順利變成路易十八的肖像。<br>* 　　　　* 　　　　*<br>一八二零年，奧地利國王往訪其倫巴底、威尼斯領土，和拿破崙遺孀瑪麗．路易絲一起，到威尼斯看歌劇。觀眾都熱烈歡呼，而且明顯是向那法國前王后歡呼。為求他們靜下來，瑪麗．路易絲唯有離開劇院，不料觀眾也都隨她離去，送她回家，只留下臉上無光的奧地利國王。</p></body></html>
