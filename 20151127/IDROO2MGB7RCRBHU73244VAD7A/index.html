</p><p>紀文鳳：I would like to bring the situation to inform the council meeting on this on July 28th, because I heard, and it was possibly reported in the newspaper, on 27th, or 26th July, that the student union chairman of HKU has announced that if their request was not met, they would barge into the Senate Room. So that's why I tried to talk to Dr Albert Chow and I said we should not let the students come into the senate room because it is a sacred place for HKU. Besides, I also sent you this email that the safety and dignity of the council members should be guaranteed as well as the image of the university.<br>But then Albert told me not to worry, because our students are very obedient, very good and I keep reminding him of the incidents on 8.18, 8.12; it's the reverse because we also had other students from other universities. Having said that, my request is that, because they already warned us of barging into the senate, I wonder why we still let them come into the 10th floor because if they already give us a warning, we should not allow them to come onto 10th floor. I think that, instead of coming here, we should be still having our meeting over there instead of trying to be scared because what we should do is to warn the students, or whoever downstairs.<br>And, I also heard later on that, from the pan-democrats, they said the 13 people, the alumni or LegCo, they do have an agreement to stay downstairs whereas the students go upstairs. It is so chaotic because this is really like what Steve has reported. It's organized, and is also orchestrated. I think we should be protected because we already heard of this alert. We should take warning, you know.<br></p><p>指應拒學生入大樓
</p><p>（我希望向校委會道明7.28的情況。報紙在7.27或7.26曾報道，港大學生會會長聲言若其訴求不被接納，就會闖進會議廳。因此我與周偉立（學生事務長）談過，我說不應讓學生進來，因這是港大的神聖地方。此外，我也向你發過電郵，希望保障校委的安全、尊嚴及大學形象。<br>然而周偉立卻叫我不用擔心，因我們的學生很乖。我提醒他8.18，8.12的情況恰恰相反，因當時有其他大學的學生在場。我的要求是，因他們早已警告會闖進會議廳，我感到疑惑，為何我們還容許他們到（紐魯詩樓）10樓，我們根本不應讓他們到10樓。我們不應被嚇怕，應繼續在該處舉行會議，而非移施到這裏（沙宣道賽馬會跨學科研究大樓）。我們應該警告那些學生和樓下所有人。<br>事發後我從泛民口中得知，他們為數13人，包括校友和立法會議員。他們協議留在樓下，學生則在樓上。正如Steve （康諾恩）所滙報，當時場面一團糟，那是有組織和精心策劃的，我們應該警惕。）<br></p><p>梁智鴻交代保安措施
</p><p>梁智鴻：I don't mean to speak twice for the discussion...First of all, we are now having basically 3 problems. First of all, improving our so-called security safety for... visit the council meetings...going back to a more decent meeting place. As I mentioned in the start, this is only a make-shift issue. This university ought to have a decent meeting place for Council, Senate and the Court and the EVP and... seek out a possible way to have a more decent place for meeting.<br>One of the things I am suggesting is that we still go to the Council chamber but we gonna make sure that there is another door that members can leave should the only exiting door be barricaded and someone throws in firebombs or something of the sort...I am very very strong in defending for a proper meeting place but not just a makeshift thing like this one...<br>Point no.2 is that the whole movement was based on the protocol designed up for the...obviously...said that it was changed as a result of the controversial incidents and the risk assessment is that...that is safety and security has to be covered. I want to bring up two points: one is that there are evidence that the registrar received complain that the students that are actually involved in the barging into the senate chamber, students while down in the car park or etc. or other people from outside... It embarrassed a lot of our council members.<br>（我不想重複討論……首先，基本上我們有3個問題。第一，改善所謂保安……校委會議……回到較體面的會議場地。正如我開首所指，這只是臨時性質。港大應為校委會、教務委員會、校董會及行政副校長，盡可能提供更體面的會議場地。我其中一個建議是我們照樣使用該會議廳，但必須確保校委可經另一道門離去，若出口被堵塞及有人掟炸彈之類……我力保一個正當的會議場地，而非這樣的臨時場地。<br>第二點是，整件事情基於預設方案……明顯地……因受爭議的事件而改變……風險評估是必須涵蓋保安。我欲提出兩點，教務長接獲一宗投訴和證據，關於牽涉闖入事件和樓下停車場的學生，或其他外來人士。那件事令很多委員尷尬。）<br></p><p>李國章促校方懲罰學生
</p><p>梁智鴻：Now we have to identify the students...from the video...to identify them and that would be an issue that perhaps the Vice-Chancellor should look into...and the setting up of ...<br>（現在我們必須認出學生……從影片認出他們，或者是校長需要處理……成立……）<br>李國章：...That would be against one student and I think...<br>（這只針對一個學生，我認為……）<br>梁智鴻：Because by protocol...<br>（因為根據方案……）<br>李國章：There's still one student...<br>（只是一個學生……）<br>梁智鴻：It's just a starting point...somebody complained of one student...<br>（這只是開始……有人投訴了一個學生……）<br>李國章：I mean...I don't know the name of the student...<br>（我是指……我不知道學生姓甚名誰）<br>梁智鴻：I would, I would advise...<br>（我會建議……）</p><p>稱可刑事控告學生
</p><p>李國章：May I suggest this, chairman, let this be passed to the SMT to identify the students involved and to take disciplinary actions, has to be reported back to the council for more action while ...to see if we agree to the action or not. Because I'm giving a very clear message that if we do not do it properly, any council member can take civil action against the students, against this council, OK? Because we are not protecting the council members...<br>（主席，我可否建議交由中央管理小組去確認涉事學生身份及採取紀律處分，並且向校委會報告以便跟進……視乎我們同意與否。因為我表達的訊息很清楚，若然我們未能適當處理此事，任何校委都可採取民事法律行動，控告學生，控告港大，OK? 因我們沒有保護校委……）<br>梁智鴻：That is what I am talking...<br>（這是我正在說的……）<br>李國章：I can take civil action against the University of Hong Kong. I can also take criminal action against the students, but I can also take civil action.（我可以民事控告港大，也可以刑事控告學生，也可民事控告。）<br>梁智鴻：I'm not disagreeing...What I am saying is that there's already a receipt of one complaint. It's only the beginning...）<br>（我不是不同意……我想說的是已有一宗投訴，這只是開始……）<br>李國章：Yeah I don't want to...<br>（是，我不想……）<br>梁智鴻：...one beginning...（一個開始……）<br>李國章：Yeah but it's not fair to single out one student...<br>（是，但只揪出一個學生並不公平……）</p><p>梁智鴻倡fb起底
</p><p>梁智鴻：Next thing...would be for the...all the facebook...identify other students...<br>（下一步……可以是……facebook……認出其他學生……）<br>李國章：Have we accepted the... report?<br>（我們是否接受了……報告？）<br>梁智鴻：Yes.（是。）<br>李國章：And ask the SMT to deal with the consequences thereof...<br>（並且要求中央管理小組處理後續……）<br>梁智鴻：Oh that's basically what it is<br>（基本上是……）<br>康諾恩：The issue is between student discipline and general public offence, if you like. The student discipline under the ordinance of statute that students dedicated... a complaint has to be raised within 28 days of an incident, and it has to be specific as I understand... and we have had one complaint and that goes to the Vice-Chancellor, and then...<br>（這事介乎學生紀律和一般罪行之間，視乎你怎樣看。根據大學條例之下學生紀律要求……必須在事發28天內提出投訴，據我理解內容必須仔細……我已有一宗投訴並轉交校長，然後……）<br><br>（編按：內文小題為編輯所擬）</p></body></html>
