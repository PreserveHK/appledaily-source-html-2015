During the battle, a cannon ball carried off the thigh of General Lanusse. This French officer had uniformly behaved with the most astonishing heroism, and the accident, which he survived only eight days, was universally lamented by his brother officers and soldiers.<br>Soon after the battle, the surgeon in chief came to Alexandria to amputate the limb, but the general refused to submit to the operation. All his friends were assembled, and the experienced surgeon said that he would be answerable for its success; he said that it would not put the life of the wounded general to the least hazard, and without it, there was no possibility of surviving. Fatigued, at length, by the solicitation of his friends, Lanusse said to them,  "No, I will not survive that dishonourable day!"<br>一八零一年三月二十一日阿歷山大*之役，英軍擊敗法軍，粉碎了拿破崙的埃及夢。戰鬥時，拉努塞將軍的一條腿給砲彈轟掉。這位法國軍官，戰場上一直英勇異常，受傷之後不過八天即去世，同袍由軍官以至士兵，無不哀痛。<br>戰後不久，軍醫總長來到亞歷山大港，要為拉努塞截肢，但拉努塞拒絕動手術。他的朋友全部到來，而那經驗豐富的軍醫說，手術保證成功，絕對不會危及性命，又說不動手術，拉努塞就性命難保。拉努塞見朋友不斷相勸，感到吃不消，就對他們說：「我不要動手術，經過那樣屈辱的一天，我還活下去做什麼！」<br>*亞歷山大港位在埃及北部，公元前三三二年由亞歷山大大帝建立。</p></body></html>
