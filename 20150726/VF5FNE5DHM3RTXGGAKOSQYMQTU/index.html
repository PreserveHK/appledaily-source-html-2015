Unconscious of the intruder's rank, he presented his bayonet and would not suffer Napoleon to pass. Napoleon told him that he was going the round of a general officer.  "Zounds!" replied the sentinel,  "you should not pass if you should be the Little Corporal himself!"* The emperor was in consequence under the necessity of retracing his steps.<br>On the following day, Napoleon, after making inquiries respecting the character and services of the soldier, which proved advantageous, summoned him to his presence. After extolling him as a rigid disciplinarian, he immediately raised him to the rank of an officer.<br>拿破崙在軍中，經常獨自夜巡軍營，看看有沒有哨兵站崗時睡覺。<br>有一次，一個士兵奉命在兩條路交叉處站崗，不許任何人經過。他不知道欲犯禁者身分，舉起刺刀，不許拿破崙走過去。拿破崙說自己是個巡夜的將級軍官，那哨兵回答說：「咄，即使小下士親來*，都不得走過這裏。」國王拿破崙唯有走回頭路。<br>第二天，拿破崙查詢那士兵的品格以及服役表現，發覺都很不錯，就把他召到跟前，稱許他嚴守軍紀，隨即提拔為軍官。<br>*Corporal（下士）是職級最低的軍士（non-commissioned officer）。拿破崙在軍中，與士兵打成一片，有如下士，所以軍中暱稱之為「小下士」。Zounds是古英語的感歎詞，表示驚訝、憤怒等情緒。</p></body></html>
