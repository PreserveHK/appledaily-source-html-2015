He escaped prison, and was flying to the French frontier when at a posting station he was recognised by the postmaster, who immediately quitted the station.<br>Lavalette thought himself discovered, and resolved upon selling his life dearly. At length, the postmaster returned unattended.  "You have the appearance of a man of honour," he said to Lavalette.  "You are going to Brussels, where you will see Count de Lavalette. Deliver him these 200 Louis d'ors, which I owe him, and which he is no doubt in want of." He then threw the money into Lavalette's carriage and withdrew, saying,  "You will be driven by my best horses."<br>滑鐵盧戰役之後，拉瓦萊特伯爵*被波旁王朝判處死刑。他逃出監獄，直奔邊境，到了一個驛站，站長認得他，匆匆離去。<br>拉瓦萊特覺得行藏已經敗露，決定拚命，最好和敵人同歸於盡。過了好一會，站長獨自回來，對他說：「你看來像個君子。現在你要去布魯塞爾，會見到拉瓦萊特伯爵。這裏有二百個金路易，是我欠他的錢，請代我還給他。他現在一定需要這筆錢。」站長說罷，把錢拋到拉瓦萊特的馬車上，站到一旁，說道：「我給你備了最好的馬。」<br>*拉瓦萊特伯爵是拿破崙的得力助手。</p></body></html>
