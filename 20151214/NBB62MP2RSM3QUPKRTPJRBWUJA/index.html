The clergyman realized it would be a risky job and protested that he could never hope to get back to England alive if he dared to talk to the French King in the manner Henry VIII wished.<br>"Don't worry about that," said the monarch soothingly.  "If the King of France puts you to death, I will cut off the heads of all the Frenchmen I can get my hands on."<br>"That may be, your majesty," replied Bonner, tapping his head.  "But of all the heads in England, there is none that fits my shoulders as well as this one does."<br>英國國王亨利八世恨法王法郎西斯一世與之爭競，委派一個牧師去法國王廷傳達口信，詞意侮慢，語帶恐嚇。那牧師叫邦納，覺得這任務很危險，提出異議說，要是依照指示，大膽向法王陳詞，一定沒命回英國。<br>亨利安慰他說：「不用擔心。要是法王把你處死，我抓到一個法國人，就殺一個。」<br>邦納拍拍頭顱，回答說：「陛下，無論你怎麼殺，英國所有人的頭顱，都不如這個頭顱那樣，可以絲毫不爽，長在我兩肩中央。」<br>*Spell可以指「（疾病等的）發作」，例如a coughing spell是「一陣咳嗽」。這個spell，改為fit字也可以，例如a fit of temper、a coughing fit等。</p></body></html>
