The fifth regiment was sent to intercept him. Napoleon approached the regiment alone, dismounted from his horse and, when he was within gunshot range, shouted,  "Here I am. Kill your emperor, if you wish." The soldiers responded with  "Long live the emperor!" and marched with Napoleon to Paris.<br>"When I landed at Cannes," said Napoleon afterwards,  "the editors of the Paris newspapers inserted articles in their respective journals, headed as follows:  'Rebellion of Bonaparte!' five days afterwards,  'General Bonaparte has entered Grenoble!' eleven days after,  'Napoleon has made his entry into Lyons!' twenty days after,  'the emperor is arrived at the Tuileries!' After this, look for public opinion in the newspapers!"<br>拿破崙．龐那巴特流放厄爾巴島將近一年，就於一八一五年二月逃回法國，第五軍團奉命前往攔截。拿破崙單騎走向軍團，一躍下馬，來到槍械射程之內，高聲喊道：「我在這裏。各位要殺國王，就動手吧。」將士答以「我王萬歲」呼聲，和拿破崙一起，望巴黎前進。<br>拿破崙事後說：「我在戛納登岸時，巴黎各報刊編輯發表報道，標題是『龐那巴特作反』；五天之後，則是『龐那巴特將軍已進格勒諾布爾』；十一天之後，則是『拿破崙已進里昂』；二十天之後，則是『國王已抵杜樂麗宮』。從此，你該懂得怎樣在報刊上看社會輿論。」</p></body></html>
