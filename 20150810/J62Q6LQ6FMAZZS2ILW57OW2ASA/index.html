He opened the letter, wrote an answer almost instantly, and ordered the hussar to carry it with all possible speed.<br>"I would do so," replied the soldier, "but my horse is nigh dead, with the haste which I have used in bringing you this letter."<br>"If that is an obstacle, take mine,"  said the general.<br>The soldier at first would not accept of it.  "Go, my comrade," rejoined Napoleon. "It may be better - it may have richer trappings than yours; but nothing is too magnificent for a French soldier." <br>拿破崙將軍在義大利為法軍總司令期間，有一次正準備上馬，參加狩獵，一個輕騎兵給他帶來一封書函。拿破崙開緘讀後，隨即寫了回信，着那騎兵火速送去。<br>那騎兵說：「我不是不想聽命，但為了盡早把信送到你手上，我一路飛馳，那匹馬已是疲累欲死。」<br>拿破崙說：「既然那匹馬跑不動，就騎我的吧。」<br>那騎兵最初不同意。拿破崙說：「老兄，去吧。我這匹馬也許好一點，馬飾也許華麗一點，但天下最好的東西，法國將士都配得上。」</p></body></html>
