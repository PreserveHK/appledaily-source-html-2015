But I think there's only one side of it. Obviously there are some members of this council, member or members of this council, who is holding a very different view in terms of public accountability, public's right to know, freedom of the press and so on. <br> <br>I would like, at this point, to challenge that whether who will do come out and try to convince us their positions. Because this is what council meeting is about --- discussion, alright? So if they have the courage to believe that what they have done is correct, I would like to challenge that person or persons to come out and say what I did that because I believe that and the reason I need you to believe.<br> <br>So that it may convince some of us, to say, ‘Look, the injunction was wrong and maybe we shouldn’t have an injunction.'Other than just hearing one side, I'd like to say whoever it is who did the recording or know about the recording come out and defend, or at least have the courage to put their case to this council. <br> <br>你（法律顧問）剛才說得很清楚。但我認為這只是單方面意見。明顯有些校委在向公眾問責、公眾知情權及新聞自由上持非常不同的觀點。<br> <br>我就此提出挑戰，有沒有人站出來並嘗試說服我們支持其立場，這就是校委會會議的意義--討論。如果他們敢於相信自己所作所為是正確，我希望挑戰他們，站出來，說明這樣做是基於他們所相信的，或者你需要我相信的理由，這樣也許能夠說服我們部份人：「禁制令是錯誤的，也許我們不該申請禁制令」。不只聽單方面意見，我希望錄音者或知情者站出來為此辯解。至少要有勇氣面對校委會。<br> <br>Yes Chairman this is exactly the point I try to refer it, it was that we just keep hearing from legal advisor telling us this is it or that. I haven’t heard an opposing view to that, alright? <br> <br>And I think in a discussion, which is what the council should be, I would like to hear an opposing view. And obviously, some people who are very passionate about this to go to the trouble of secretly illicitly recording council proceeding--- probably right now! I would like to see… if they got the courage to come out and say ‘Yes I believe this is freedom of whatever!’ So I put the challenge to them. <br> <br>是的，主席。這點正是我想說的。我們只聽到法律顧問解釋，但聽不到相反意見。這是一場討論，校委會本該是這樣。我希望聽到相反的觀點，顯然有些人對他自己的理念是這麼深信不疑，因此還費勁去非法偷錄會議過程--可能現時也在偷錄！我想知他們有沒有勇氣站出來說：「是的，我相信這就是諸如此類的自由！」因此我挑戰他們。<br> <br>Thank you Chairman. I think one of the…firstly I ought to state a conflict of interest that… I’d like to declare it first. I see it as two important issues. One I agree with the first thing that it is the reputation of the university that we believe in confidentiality to protect other people not so much ourselves.<br> <br>But the second important issue I think is that we must have a better public relation, because, at the moment, it makes as if we're trying to keep confidential in order to hide something, that we have something that we should look out.So it is transparency.<br> <br>Oh! These people are all bad guys that are hiding. And quite honestly, I have nothing to hide. I'm very happy to have everything I said including this meeting to be released to the public. But at the same time the whole emphasis is that we are hiding something, we are doing something underhand. And I think if we take the root that we are gonna uphold confidentiality we have to be very clear in our public relation that we're not doing it in order to hide something. <br> <br>多謝主席。首先我必須申報。我認為這牽涉兩個重點。我同意這關乎大學聲譽，必須保護其他人。但第二個重點是，我們的公關必須做得更好。現在我們看似企圖利用保密制加以隱瞞一些事情和一些東西需要提防。「這關乎透明度。噢！這些全都是壞人，全都躲起來！」老實說我沒有事情需要隱瞞。我很樂意公開我在會上說的話。但現在外界焦點是我們隱瞞了一些事情，暗中做了一些事。若果我們決定堅守保密原則，在公關上必須說清楚，我們這樣做不是有所隱瞞。<br> <br>【11月24日會議，討論如何懲處開記招披露會議內容的港大學生會會長馮敬恩，李國章發言摘錄】<br>I think the important thing is that, for the Vice-Chancellor has already said, is that he has breached confidentiality, full stop.<br> <br>正如校長所言，我認為重點是他（馮敬恩）有否違反保密原則？僅此而已。<br> <br>Now it is mitigation, whether you accept it or not, he believes in transparency and openness. And then, for he would make decision on every item, whether he would disclose confidentiality. In other words, for every item in the future, we will have to rely on his judgment to say, you know, this is openness and I am gonna disclose so and so or so and so said and so on.<br> <br>不論你接受與否，他的辯解是相信透明和開放原則。他會自行判斷應否披露個別內容。換言之，往後會議所有內容，將取決於他的判斷，如他認為這關乎開放原則，就會披露...<br> <br>I think this is a fundamental breach of collective responsibility which, according to our code, is paramount. We may disappoint you to certain decision, but if we disagree with certain decisions because of openness and transparency, we argue it out in this meeting; we don’t go outside of this meeting.<br> <br>我認為這徹底違反了集體負責制，而這是守則最為重要的。我們的決定可能令你失望，但若果有意見分歧，我們應該在會議上辯論，而非帶出去。<br> <br>If you could not keep this, I cannot see how we could go back to any restricted or confidential items until he is prepared to say that he is going to lead part of the collective responsibility, unless he is going to sign the code of confidentiality. I cannot see how we can have a member here and we wasted an hour just arguing over this and each time, each meeting we would get arguing over this again and again.<br> <br>如果你不遵守（保密制），我們不可能重新討論任何受限制或保密議題，直至他肯承擔集體責任。除非你簽署保密條款，我們一眾校委只會每次開會都浪費一小時去爭吵，永無休止。<br> <br>So, lets be very clear to say that, yes, you have breached confidentiality. And now the question is: do we accept the fact that his reason is openness, transparency and public interest? We accept that, fine. We can take a vote on that and accept that. Then in that case there will be no more confidentiality in this council, alright? And this is a fundamental change of policy of this university.<br> <br>讓大家說清楚，是，你是違反了保密協議。問題是，我們是否接受以開放、透明和公眾利益作為理由？如果接受，好的，我們以投票方式通過。但往後校委會再也沒有保密可言，這也將徹底改變大學政策。<br> <br>If on the other hand we don’t accept his mitigation, then we will say, stop what we want and you are now excluded from all confidentiality. It is really as simple as that my chairman<br> <br>若果我們不接受此辯解，我們必須停止，你將不能參與討論保密議題。主席，就是這樣簡單。</p></body></html>
