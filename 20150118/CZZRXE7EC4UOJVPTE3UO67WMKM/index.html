A French lancer passing by saw him move and exclaiming  "You're not dead, villain," he stuck his lance into Ponsonby's back.<br>Not long after, another French soldier came up. He went down on his knees under pretence of re-loading his musket. It was with the view, however, of possessing Ponsonby's purse, which he had no sooner taken then he scampered off.<br>Then came a French officer. He stooped down, saw that Ponsonby was badly wounded, and ordered one of his soldiers to lay Pondonby straight on his side, and place a knapsack under his head. Ponsonby complained of thirst, and the French officer held his brandy bottle to Ponsonby's lips. Ponsonby wrote in a subsequent narrative:  "He then passed on into action - soon, perhaps, to want, though not receive, the same assistance; and I shall never know to whose generosity I was indebted for my life."<br>滑鐵盧一役，英國軍官龐森比上校遭軍刀砍於馬下，一個法國長矛騎兵經過，見他還在動，喊一聲「惡棍，你還未死」，就在他背上補上一矛。<br>不久，另一法國士兵來到，跪下來，假裝給火槍再裝上彈藥，其實卻是要取龐森比的錢包。錢包一得手，他就匆匆離去。<br>跟着來了個法國軍官。他俯下身，見龐森比傷勢嚴重，叫手下一名士兵先把龐森比的身體擺好，側身而卧，再拿個背包給他枕頭。龐森比說口渴，那軍官就把隨身的白蘭地酒瓶送到他嘴邊。龐森比後來記述說：「那軍官離去，繼續作戰。也許，他很快就會希望獲得他給我那樣的協助，卻得不到。而我永遠都不會知道，這位慷慨救我一命的人是誰。」<br></p></body></html>
