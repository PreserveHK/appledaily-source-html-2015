I just want to make a few comments, but the comments...when I make this comment that I understand, that I totally understand my duty as a member of the Council, particularly in terms of the appointment of senior executive in this Council. I understand that and I understand the duty. And to me, there is no emotion in that. What I said later is something that I really give a lot of thought into it. <br>(多謝主席。我想給一點意見。我完全明白任命高級行政人員是校委的職責。對我來說，這不牽涉任何情感。我將會說的話是經過深思熟慮。)<br>I know this candidate very well. In fact we were in the same class when we were in LSE. So I know the candidate well. It's not that I don't understand him, I don't know him. And I read the paper and every piece of paper on my table, and I exercise my independent thinking without anybody intervening. With the biggest interest of the University, wide and long of the University, and before I make my comment, so I know what I am doing. </p><p>(我很了解這位申請者，事實上我們在倫敦政治經濟學院是同班同學。我並非不認識他，或不了解他。我閱過案頭所有文件，經過獨立思考而未受任何人干預。我從港大最大利益，廣闊而長遠的角度出發，我知道自己正在做甚麼。)<br>In the last two years or so, this University, just like Hong Kong, has been undergoing quite a bumpy journey, in a sense that so many things happening in Hong Kong. It started from the University, the 8.18 visit of Li Keqiang and also the Occupy Central thing, the donation issue, and recently about this appointment of this Vice President and PVC. In fact the last two years and a half, it's pretty sickening in a sense, you can see that so many discussion, division, particularly and entirely divided, you know, the community.<br>(過去兩年多，港大正如香港一樣走過顛簸的路途，香港發生很多事。從港大的李克強8.18訪校事件、佔領中環、捐款風波，以至最近副校任命，過去兩年半，我對這麼多討論，尤其社會分裂感到很厭惡。)<br>And I can understand, I mean, University as part of the wider Hong Kong community that reflect whatever happened in Hong Kong in the University, I can understand, but what bother me a lot is about this division, now the problem of this division is that it continues to divide the University. <br>(我明白港大作為香港社會的一部份，港大發生的事反映香港現況。然而令我很困擾的是分裂，現在問題是這些事情繼續分裂港大。)<br>I don't talk about Hong Kong, just about this University. It really, I think to me, is becoming a distraction of the University and it prevents the University actually to look longer term. In the last two years, I've been sitting in this Council every month, even more work than my own board meeting, but we never have a chance to talk about what makes up this University. Have we ever even think of any opportunities that we should grasp and let this University shine and glow?<br>(莫說香港，僅說港大。港大的注意力正被轉移，未能長遠展望。過去兩年，我每個月都出席校委會會議，工作量較我本身的董事局會議還要繁重，但從沒機會討論港大的本質。我們何曾想過把握機遇，讓港大發熱發亮？)<br>I've been patiently waiting, you know, the new VC coming to this University with a hope that we have a smooth strategy of development. No time. No discussions. Everything has been pre-occupied and dominated by this sided political issue, the issues that are so divided in the community. And I am sickening. <br>(我耐心等待，期望新校長帶來穩妥發展策略。沒時間。沒討論。所有事情都被政治議題佔據和主導，而社會對這些議題非常分化。我感到很厭惡。)<br>And then when I think of this appointment, I give a pause into looking into whether this candidate would further divide the University, or unite the University. I asked this question because I want to see this unity, so that we're able to see this University continue to glow. Because of the potential controversy of this candidate...I don't say whether, you know, the candidate is wrong or why we can bring this up...because there is a potential controversy. It exists whether you, whatever position you...whether you are on yellow camp or the blue camp...I don't care. But the potential controversy exists. <br>(當考慮這項任命，我會檢視申請人將進一步分裂港大，還是團結港大。因我希望看見團結，港大才會繼續散發光芒。由於申請人具潛在爭議，我不是說申請人有錯或為何我們須提及這點……這確有潛在爭議。不論是黃色還是藍色陣營，我不在乎，但潛在爭議確實存在。)<br>And because of a strong political position of this candidate, and I do not have enough confidence that this candidate would probably help to unite. But on the contrary, he probably would further divide. Now this is a senior executive position that's on academic staffing and resources. I've been a chair of HRPC for several years. and I think that this is important that we look for person...I think in a lot of cases during my career to appoint a lot of senior executives, persons can be qualified but may not be suitable. I know this candidate well. He's a good gentleman. But sometimes for a lot of other reasons, he may not be totally suitable. And I have to say, because of the controversy that exists, because of his strong political position, because of the potential risk of further divide the community, I have to say I do not have enough confidence to accept this recommendation. And I want the candidate, at least, the future PVC or the Vice President, must be able to unite and must not politicize the working place that he is working in. <br>(由於申請人具強烈政治取向，我沒有足夠信心他能幫助港大團結，反之他可能進一步分裂港大。這是關於學術人事及資源的高級行政職位，我在（校委會屬下）人力資源政策委員會當了數年主席，我認為挑選人選時關鍵在於……我過去工作上聘請過很多高級行政人員，很多個案都是符合資格但並不合適。我很了解這名申請人。他是一個好人。但有時基於很多其他原因，他或許不是最合適。我必須說明，基於現時存在的爭議、基於申請人的強烈政治立場、基於進一步令社會分裂的潛在風險，我必須指出我沒有足夠信心去接受這項（物色委員會推薦陳文敏）建議。我要求未來的副校必須能夠團結港大，而非令其工作環境政治化。)<br>So on that basis, Chairman, I would suggest that we go for another search and I cannot accept the recommendation as proposed. Thank you.<br>(基於以上原因，主席，我建議大家另覓人選。我不能接受此建議。多謝。)</p></body></html>
