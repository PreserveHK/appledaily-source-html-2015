I agree with Rosanna's analysis on the division of Hong Kong in the way that Hong Kong U has been caught up in that. (...) it's not correct to say that what is happening is that we are not focusing on strategic development (...) unfortunately no one is interested in it, the press is not interested in it, no one wants to input news stories, everyone wants to hear controversy (...) There's great deal going on, you notice in my report the structured way that I talk about that, just one of the recent manifestations but there's a number of new initiatives, a number of exciting developments coming from the new vice presidents and the new deans (...) It is just not correct for anyone to think that the University of Hong Kong is standing still while this controversy rages. <br>That's not to say I don't want the controversy over as well, of course I do. I personally don't think any of the three outcomes I highlighted will be a force for unity. But I do think that, I just want to make a point that I think this is my job to continue making this and trying to do it. Every time I'm given the opportunity to speak publicly...it's a great deal going on, the University of Hong Kong, a great deal of development, we're not standing still. <br>(我有一個回應。我同意Rosanna對香港分裂的分析及港大如何牽連其中（……）我們並沒專注發展策略的說法並不正確（……）不幸地沒人對此有興趣，傳媒沒興趣，沒人想報道，所有人想聽的是爭議……大學的重大工作正在進行，你留意到我已在報告有條理地介紹，這是最近（重大工作）的展現……新上任的副校和院長提出一些新倡議，也有些工作進展令人興奮（……）若有任何人認為港大在激烈的爭議中原地踏步，這是錯誤的。<br>這不代表我不想爭議完結，我當然想。我不認為我前述的3個結果（編按：通過任命陳文敏，否決任命或暫不決議）中任何一個能夠成為團結的動力。我希望強調我的工作是繼續促使或嘗試完成，每次我有機會公開發表言論……重大工作正在進行，港大有重大發展，我們並非原地踏步。)<br>王䓪鳴：Chairman, may I just make one point?（主席我可否回應一點）<br>校委主席梁智鴻：Please go.（請說）<br>王䓪鳴：Thank you the VC for this, you know, comment. But when I said this I refer particularly to the Council. The Council has no time for discussion on this issue, and every discussion in the Council meeting would be bothered by all these controversies. And therefore in my view, I'm glad to hear that at this University, you know, have some new thinking, and that's why I just asked you about this strategy which I look forward and I'm particularly interested to move forward the University. I love this University so much. And I've served this University for so many years. And this is my alma matar too. And I think we must grasp every opportunity to make it so. And that is the reason why I think I do not want to see anybody coming in and further divide, I would rather to see the potential of uniting this University. And this is my argument.<br>(感謝校長的意見。但我指的是校委會。校委會沒有時間討論（大學發展）。會內所有討論都被這些爭議干擾。我很高興聽到港大現在有些新想法，這是為何我剛才向你詢問有關大學發展策略的問題，我對此很期待，我對港大如何向前走尤其感興趣。我深愛港大，我在港大服務了很多年，這也是我的母校。我們必須把握每個機遇。正是這個原因，我不想看見任何人走進來再搞分裂，我希望看見港大有團結的可能。這就是我的論點。)</p></body></html>
