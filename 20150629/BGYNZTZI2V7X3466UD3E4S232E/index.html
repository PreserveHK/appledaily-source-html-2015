Coutel, captain of the Aerostatic Corps, ascended with the Entreprenant balloon and conducted the important service of taking notes on the movements of the Austrian army, dropping them to the ground for collection. He also signalled messages to the French army, which in consequence was victorious.<br>Coutel's intended ascent had been known to the Austrians, who, at the moment when the balloon began to take its flight, opened the fire of a battery against it, but the balloon soon reached such a degree of altitude as to be beyond the reach of cannon shot.<br>法國的懸浮空軍團一七九四年成立，是世上第一支空軍。<br>一七九四年六月二十六日，法國和奧地利戰於弗勒呂斯。懸浮空軍團上尉庫特爾乘冒險號氣球升空，執行觀察奧軍調動的重任，並把所見筆錄，拋給戰地上的法軍。此外，他還打信號，通消息。法軍因此得勝。<br>奧軍早已知道庫特爾準備升空窺探，一見氣球開始升起，就開砲轟擊，但氣球不久就升上高空，非砲彈所能及。</p></body></html>
