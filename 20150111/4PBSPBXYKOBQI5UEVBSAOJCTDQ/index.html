On their way, they had a skirmish with four Germans and killed them, but Moriber's pistol was hit by gunfire and rendered useless. Others in the patrol had little or no ammunition.<br>They continued on to the stone quarry and Moriber ordered the Germans to come out, telling them they were surrounded by American troops. Eight came out with their hands up and dropped their guns. The others inside opened fire. When the going got tough Moriber was able to get his hands on a gun that would shoot. They killed eight Germans. After that the Germans remaining in the quarry obeyed and surrendered. Moriber and his three men marched them back to camp. They were  100 in all.<br>一九四三年盟軍登陸義大利之後，美軍中尉雷諾德．莫里伯有一天和另外三人奉命外出偵察。他決定去一個採石場，看看那裏有沒有德軍。路上，他們和四個德軍交戰，把他們格殺，但莫里伯的手槍也被槍火擊中損毀，不能再用。而巡邏組其他三人幾乎已無彈藥。<br>他們走到採石場，莫里伯命令場內德軍走出來，說他們已被美軍包圍。八個德軍舉起雙手，從採石場走出，把槍拋下，但其餘的德軍卻開火頑抗。交戰激烈時，莫里伯取得一枝可用的槍。他們殺了八個德軍，採石場餘下的德軍就聽命投降。莫里伯和他三名手下把他們押回軍營。這批德軍共一百人。</p></body></html>
