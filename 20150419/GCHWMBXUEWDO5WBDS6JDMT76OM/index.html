He sought an asylum with a poor peasant named Perrier. No one asked his name, the events of the times having accustomed the peasants to the sight of the persecuted.<br>One day, Perrier returned from town, and talked about those wanted by the government.  "Two thousand four hundred francs are offered for the head of Parson Brieres, and ten thousand for that of General Gilly."<br>"Hark you, my friend," said Gilly,  "you are poor, and can have no objection to earning money. I know General Gilly, and the place where he is concealed. We will denounce him - I demand my liberty for my reward, and you shall have the ten thousand francs."<br>Perrier was petrified. His son, a man of 27, sprang up and said menacingly,  "Sir, there is the door, hasten away by it, or I will throw you out of the window."<br>Greatly moved, Gilly made himself known to them.<br>滑鐵盧戰役之後，拿破崙手下勇將吉利將軍遭懸賞緝捕，獲一個叫佩里耶的貧困農人收留避禍。沒有人問他姓名：當時被迫害者太多，農人都司空見慣。<br>有一天，佩里耶從鎮上回家，談到政府緝拿的人：「布里埃斯牧師的頭顱，值二千四百法郎；吉利將軍的頭顱，值一萬法郎。」<br>吉利說：「老兄，聽着。你家境清貧，不會不想賺錢。我認識吉利將軍，也知道他藏身的地點。我們舉報他吧：我要的報酬，是恢復自由，而你則可得一萬法郎。」<br>佩里耶目瞪口呆，他二十七歲的兒子則跳起來，威脅說：「老兄，你快從這道門滾出去，否則我把你擲出窗口。」吉利深受感動，向他們說明了自己的身分。</p></body></html>
