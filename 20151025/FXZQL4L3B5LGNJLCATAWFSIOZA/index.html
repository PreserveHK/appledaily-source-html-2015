He enclosed two tickets,  "One for yourself and one for a friend -- if you have one."<br>Expressing his regret at being unable to attend, Churchill replied, asking if it would be possible to have tickets for the second night -- "if there is one."<br>*　　　　　　*　　　　　　*<br>Churchill was accosted at a wartime reception by a rather overbearing American lady.  "What are you going to do about those wretched Indians?" she demanded.<br>"Madam," replied Churchill,  "to which Indians do you refer? Do you refer to the second greatest nation on earth, which under benign and munificent British rule has multiplied and prospered exceedingly? Or to the unfortunate North American Indians, which under your present administration are almost extinct?"<br>蕭伯納寄短簡給邱吉爾，邀他觀看《聖女貞德》第一晚演出，附入場券兩張：「一張予先生，一張予貴友──如先生尚有朋友。」<br>邱吉爾回信說，當晚未能出席，深以為憾，並問可不可以改贈第二晚的入場券──「如演出尚有第二晚」。<br>*　　　　　　*　　　　　　*<br>戰時一個接待會上，一個盛氣凌人的美國女士走到邱吉爾跟前，問道：「那些可憐的印人，你會怎樣處理？」<br>邱吉爾回答：「姑娘，你說的是什麼印人？是那個世界第二大國，即在英國的仁厚統治之下，富庶非常的大國，還是北美那些不幸的印第安人，即在貴國現政府統治之下，幾乎滅絕的印人？」</p></body></html>
