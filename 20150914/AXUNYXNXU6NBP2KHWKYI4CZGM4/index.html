"You don't mean to say you think Cameron would steal?" asked Lincoln.  "No," was the reply,  "I don't think he'd steal a red-hot stove."<br>Amused by this, Lincoln repeated it to Cameron, who insisted that Stevens should retract. Going to see Lincoln at the White House, Stevens said,  "Why did you tell Cameron what I said?"  "I thought it was a good joke: I never thought it would make him mad."  "Well, he is mad and made me promise to retract. So I will. I believe I told you he would not steal a red-hot stove. I now take that back."<br>美國南北戰爭期間，撒迪厄斯．史蒂文斯①向林肯進言，說西門．卡梅倫②不可信任，不宜掌陸軍部。林肯問：「你不是說，卡梅倫會偷東西吧？」史蒂文斯回答：「不是。我是說，他不會偷灼熱的火爐。」<br>林肯覺得這話很有趣，就跟卡梅倫說。卡梅倫誓要史蒂文斯把言論收回。史蒂文斯去白宮見林肯，問道：「你為什麼把我的話告訴卡梅倫？」「我覺得你所言有趣得很，實在想不到他會大發雷霆。」「他現在氣瘋了，還要我答應把言論收回。我就收回吧。我記得跟你說過，他不會偷灼熱的火爐，我收回這句話。」<br>①史蒂文斯時任美國國會議員。<br>②卡梅倫在任期間，頗有貪污醜聞。</p></body></html>
