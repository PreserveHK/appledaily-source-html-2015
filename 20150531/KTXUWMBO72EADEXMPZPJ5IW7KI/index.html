Seeing him, Napoleon burst into tears. The duke, embracing Napoleon, reminded him of all the services he had done him, and then said, "In dying for you I have no cause to interest you on behalf of my wife and my children: it is a duty you owe to your glory to protect them, nor do I fear to change your intentions towards them by addressing to you the last reproaches of friendship. Your insatiable ambition will prove your downfall: you sacrifice without reason and regret those very men who serve you the best. You are no longer environed but by flatterers. I do not perceive one friend who dares to tell you the truth. You will be sold, you will be abandoned. Terminate speedily this war; it is the wish of your generals, and it is doubtless that of your people also. Forgive these home truths from a dying man."<br>As the duke pronounced these words, Napoleon wept bitterly.<br>拿破崙好朋友蒙泰貝洛在一八零九年的埃斯林戰役之中，受傷將死，拿破崙見了，傷心下淚。蒙泰貝洛抱着拿破崙，把過去為他效力的事一一重提，然後說：「我為你而死，不必以妻子兒女相託。為了你自己的榮譽，你有責任保護他們。我也不怕臨終對你善意相責，會改變你對我家人的態度。你野心無窮，終將失敗。你犧牲最能為你效力的人，毫無原因，毫無悔意。今天，你周圍只有脅肩諂笑之徒，沒有一個朋友敢進忠言。你將會被出賣，被拋棄。快終止這場戰爭吧：這是你手下將領的願望，也無疑是百姓的願望。請原諒垂死之人說的逆耳之言。」<br>蒙泰貝洛說話時，拿破崙痛哭流涕。</p></body></html>
