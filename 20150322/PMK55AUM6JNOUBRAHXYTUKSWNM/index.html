"You are perfectly in the right,"  answered Napoleon,  "for everyone fights for that which he does not possess."<br>*               *               *<br>A person one day solicited the Empress Josephine to intercede with Napoleon in favour of a young man, who was condemned as an accomplice in a certain great crime.  "It is the first favour of this kind that I have ever asked of you,"  said the empress to Napoleon, " and I hope you will grant it."<br>"I cannot, madam,"  said Napoleon.<br>"Can you refuse it to me ?"<br>"Yes, madam,"  Napoleon continued, "  and when it is known that I have refused it to you, no one else will dare to ask it."<br>拿破崙還是陸軍中尉的時候，一個俄國軍官洋洋自得說，俄國人為光榮而戰，法國人則為利益而戰。拿破崙回答說：「你的話一點不錯。人總是要爭取自己沒有的東西。」<br>*               *               *<br>有一天，某人懇求約瑟芬王后為一個少年向拿破崙說情：那少年是一宗嚴重罪案的從犯，已經判刑。約瑟芬對拿破崙說：「這是我第一次向你提出這樣的請求，希望你會答應。」<br>拿破崙說：「夫人，我不可以照准。」<br>「你連我都拒絕？」<br>拿破崙說：「不錯，夫人。而當大家知道我連你都拒絕，以後就沒有人再敢請託。」</p></body></html>
