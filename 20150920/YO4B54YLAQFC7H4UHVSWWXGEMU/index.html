One of the most powerful rulers of his age, he led the Holy League against France.<br>A cardinal of Spain, having charge under the Pope of an army, and seeing it necessary to try the fortune of battle against the enemies of the Pope's Holiness, valiantly encouraged his soldiers to show themselves like men, assuring them that if they sacrificed their lives in that conflict, they not only would have full pardon of their sins, but also would that morning go dine with God and his angels in heaven. When he had thus said, he withdrew himself from the battle. A soldier standing near by said to him, "Right Reverend Father, why do you not tarry with us that you might also go dine this morning with God and his angels?"  "Hold your peace, knave," said the cardinal,  "I have no inclination to eat now; it is too early for me; my stomach is not yet come to me."<br>教皇朱利葉斯二世外號「戰鬥教皇」，一五零三年到一五一三年在位，權重一時，率領神聖聯盟對抗法國。<br>西班牙一位樞機主教獲朱利葉斯委以一支軍隊，眼看須和教皇的敵人上戰場一決雌雄，就以勇敢的口吻，鼓勵將士，教他們要有男兒氣概，並向他們力言，要是戰場之上壯烈犧牲，一生罪惡都會獲得原宥，還可當天早上就上天堂，和上帝、天使一起進餐。說罷，這位樞機主教即引身而退。站在附近的一個士兵問他說：「主教，為什麼不留在我們之間？這樣，你今早也會有機會去和上帝、天使一起進餐。」那樞機主教說：「你這個無賴，住口！我現在不想進食。對我來說，現在太早了，我還沒有胃口。」</p></body></html>
