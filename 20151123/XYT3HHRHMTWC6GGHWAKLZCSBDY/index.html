Caught in a rain shower, he offered the shelter of his umbrella to a stranger walking in the same direction as himself.<br>The stranger was also bound for the reception, but confided that he was going only to satisfy a personal curiosity, having never seen Grant.  "Between us," he explained,  "I have always thought that Grant was a very much overrated man."<br>"That's my view also," Grant said.<br>Grant became the 18th president of the United States in 1869.<br>攸利西斯．格蘭特在美國南北戰爭期間，任北軍統帥，和林肯總統緊密合作，擊敗南部邦聯。有一次，他去出席一個為他而設的酒會，路上遇上驟雨，見有個陌生人和他同路，就䇛起雨傘，和那人同行，給他擋雨。<br>那人原來也是去出席那個酒會。他告訴格蘭特說，此去只是由於好奇，因為他從沒見過格蘭特。他說：「不怕跟你說句私人話，我向來認為格蘭特之名遠遠過於其實。」<br>格蘭特回答說：「我也是這麼想。」<br>一八六九年，格蘭特成為美國第十八任總統。</p></body></html>
