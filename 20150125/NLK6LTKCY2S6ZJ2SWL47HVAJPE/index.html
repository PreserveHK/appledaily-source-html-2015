In the advance of the British 88th Regiment, the two officers carrying the colours of the corps noticed one of the French taking aim in their direction. One of them called out,   "That fellow is aiming at me."  "I am devilish glad to hear you say so," replied the other, "for I thought he had me covered!" But they were both mistaken. The ball killed Major Murphy. The fall of their favourite officer excited the 88th to madness, and they could scarcely be kept back from the charge. The French were soon flying before their bayonets.<br>Many were the heroic deeds performed at Salamanca. A British soldier of the 43rd, who was shot through the thigh, and lost his shoes in passing a marshy stream, refused to quit the fight. He marched with naked feet for several miles over a country covered with sharp stones, a stream of blood flowing from his wound.<br>一八一二年七月，即拿破崙戰爭期間，英葡聯軍在西班牙薩拉曼卡擊敗法軍。英軍第八十八軍團前進時，掌軍旗的兩名軍官看見一名法國士兵持槍朝他們瞄準。一人說：「那傢伙瞄準我。」另一人說：「那好極了，我還以為他是要向我開槍。」但他們都錯了。那顆子彈射殺了摩菲少校，軍團士兵見他們愛戴的軍官倒下，憤恨若狂，衝鋒之勢無可遏止。法軍不久就在他們的刺刀之前潰敗。<br>薩拉曼卡一役有不少英勇事迹。英軍四十三軍團有個士兵，大腿遭子彈洞穿，一雙鞋子也在走過一條泥濘小河時脫落，但他不肯退出戰場，在滿布尖銳石頭的地區，赤腳走了幾英里，傷口還不斷流血。<br></p></body></html>
