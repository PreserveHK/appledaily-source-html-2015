Being told that in fact they had laid down their arms in token of peace, he added:  "I believe it indeed; otherwise their assassins would not have dared to look them in the face."<br>And at St Helena, Napoleon said,  "I would consent to live for only three more years, provided it were permitted me to pass them in France as a simple citizen. With what pleasure would I visit my old companions in arms! I would go to seek them at the plough and in the manufactories. If it should happen that grief and disappointment conduct me to the tomb, the misfortunes of the ancient army will contribute something towards it."<br>滑鐵盧戰役之後，在馬賽港以及南部一些省分，有法國將士遭屠殺。拿破崙聽說，氣憤如狂，高聲說：「他們一定是沒有武器！」言事者告訴他，那些將士其實已放下兵戈，以示和平。拿破崙說：「這一點我毫不懷疑。不是如此，偷襲者根本不敢正視他們。」<br>在聖赫勒拿島上，拿破崙說：「假如我獲准回到法國，做個普通公民，那麼，即使只能再活三年，我也願意。探望舊日同袍，該是多麼開心的事！我會走到田間，或走進工廠，尋覓他們。要是我終將在悲傷失意之中去世，我舊部的不幸遭遇，當是原因之一。」</p></body></html>
