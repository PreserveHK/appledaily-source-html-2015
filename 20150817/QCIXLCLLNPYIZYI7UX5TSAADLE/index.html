He pronounced his last intelligible words some time after four o'clock in the morning. They were something like  <em> tete de l'armee</em>  -  "at the head of the army". After that there were only moans and groans. During the last twelve hours of his agony, he lay motionless, with only an occasional tear rolling down his cheeks from his unseeing eyes.<br>The postmortem report by British medical officers on  6 May  1821 concluded that Napoleon died from extensive cancerous lesions of the stomach.<br>一八二一年五月五日早上五時四十五分，拿破崙去世，侍候在旁的有十六人，包括朋友、朋友的家屬，幾個醫師，以及三兩個僕人。早上四點鐘之後不久，他說了死前最後幾個還聽得懂的字，說的大概是tete de l'armee，即「帶領着軍隊」。此後，就只有呻吟。在痛苦的最後十二小時，他一直躺着不動，雙眼若無所見，只是偶然流下一滴淚水。<br>一八二一年五月六日英國醫務人員的驗屍報告認為，拿破崙死於胃部大面積的癌症潰腫。</p></body></html>
