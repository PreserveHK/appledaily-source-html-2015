This speech was a tissue of eulogies from beginning to end.<br>One of the young students quitted his form, went up to the professor, and delivered to him his notebook, on which he had written a quotation from J B Rousseau②:  "And can I force my lips to praise a ferocious hero, born for the misfortune of mankind?"<br>When Napoleon was informed of the circumstance, he asked,  "Has this young man any talents? Does he promise to become a good soldier?" On being told that he was one of the ablest students of the class, Napoleon said, "Very well, let him give vent to his passion. I shall present him with a handsome epaulet, and he will one day become one of my best officers."<br>一八一一年三月十二日，巴黎一所王室書院的學生接到作文題目，文章要以路易．德封塔納①致拿破崙的講詞為據。那篇講詞，徹頭徹尾是歌頌剛從奧地利征戰回來的拿破崙。<br>一個年輕學生離開座位，走到教授跟前，展示他的筆記本，其上寫了盧梭②的一句話：「我怎能強違良心，歌頌為患人類的殘暴英雄？」<br>拿破崙聽到這件事，問道：「那年輕人的才能怎樣？可以成為出色軍人嗎？」言事者說那年輕人是個優秀學生，拿破崙就說：「那很好，由他發洩一下激烈情懷吧。我會委任他做軍官。他有一天會成為我的得力助手。」<br>①路易．德封塔納是法國詩人兼政客。<br>②盧梭是法國詩人兼劇作家，一七四一年去世。</p></body></html>
