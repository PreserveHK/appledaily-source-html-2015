I was one day walking with her, inspecting our positions in the neighbourhood of Col de Tende,* when I suddenly took it into my head, to give her an idea of an engagement, and for this purpose ordered the attack of an advanced post. We were the conquerors, it is true; but the affair could be attended by no advantage. The attack was a mere whim, and yet it cost the lives of several men. I have never failed to reproach myself whenever I look back on this affair."<br>拿破崙放逐聖赫拿島之後，曾經談到往日和某人民代表美貌的妻子有一段情誼：<br>「我給了她一個好印象，於是沾沾自喜，一有機會，就盡力向她獻殷勤。有一天，我和她同行，巡視我軍在滕達山口*附近的陣地。我忽然想給她看看交戰的情況，就下令進攻敵軍前哨站。我們不錯是戰勝了，但這一戰軍事上其實毫無好處。我只是一時興之所至，卻傷了幾條人命。每次想到這件事，我都不免自責。」<br>*滕達山口位在法國和義大利邊界。拿破崙所述的這個故事，發生於一七九三年，當時拿破崙不過二十多歲，還未得志。</p></body></html>
