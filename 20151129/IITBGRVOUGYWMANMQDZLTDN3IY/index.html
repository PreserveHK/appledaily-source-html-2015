"Orders must be strictly and promptly obeyed always," said Grant.<br>Some days later the same recruit was put on guard of a steamboat laden with ammunition. His orders were to prevent anyone with a lighted pipe or cigar from approaching the boat. In due course General Grant appeared and made to board the vessel, one of his beloved cigars between the teeth.<br>"Halt!" cried the recruit, and raised his gun.<br>The general, surprised and annoyed at this apparent impertinence, demanded an explanation.<br>"I have been taught to obey orders strictly and promptly," replied the soldier,  "and my orders are to allow no one to approach this boat with a lighted cigar. You will please throw yours away."<br>Grant was forced to smile on hearing his own words quoted back at him, and obediently tossed his cigar into the river.<br>一八六一年，美國南北戰爭之初，北軍指揮官攸利西斯．格蘭特見一年輕新兵放哨時，擅離崗位，把他斥責了一頓，告訴他說：「命令必須馬上並嚴格執行，無有例外。」<br>有一天，那新兵奉命看守一艘滿載火藥的汽船，不許任何燃點了煙斗或雪茄的人靠近。不久，格蘭特將軍到來，叼着他喜愛的雪茄，舉步準備登船。<br>那新兵舉槍喝道：「站着！」<br>格蘭特覺得他目無尊長，愕然之餘，很不高興，問他這算是什麼。<br>那新兵說：「我受過教訓，知道命令必須馬上並嚴格執行，而我奉命不許任何燃點了雪茄的人靠近。請把雪茄丟掉。」<br>格蘭特見那新兵引用他的話對付他，只有強笑，如命把雪茄丟進河裏。</p></body></html>
