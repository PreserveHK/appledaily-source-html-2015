Secured only by a rope around his waist, he managed not only to smother the fire but also to return along the wing to the aircraft's cabin.<br>Churchill, an admirer as well as a performer of swashbuckling exploits, summoned the shy New Zealander to  10 Downing Street. Ward, struck dumb with awe in Churchill's presence, was unable to answer the prime minister's questions.<br>Churchill viewed the unhappy hero with some compassion.  "You must feel very humble and awkward in my presence," he said.<br>"Yes, sir," managed Ward.<br>"Then you can imagine how humble and awkward I feel in yours," said Churchill.<br>一九四一年夏天，詹姆斯．沃德中士獲頒維多利亞十字勳章，嘉許他在一萬三千英尺高空，下臨須德海*，爬出他那架威靈頓轟炸機的機艙，走到機翼上，撲滅右舷發動機的火焰，成功之後，還沿機翼走回機艙裏，其間只有一條長繩繫腰，以保安全。<br>邱吉爾行事喜歡逞豪雄，也欣賞那樣的行為。他召喚這位害臊的紐西蘭人到唐寧街十號首相府。沃德在邱吉爾跟前，十分惶恐，以致不能回答邱吉爾的問題。<br>邱吉爾望着這位局促不安的英雄，同情心起，說道：「你在我跟前，一定感到十分卑微、尷尬。」<br>沃德勉強吐出一句話：「不錯，首相。」<br>邱吉爾說：「那麼，你一定可以想到，我在你跟前，感到多麼卑微、尷尬。」<br>*須德海位在荷蘭西部。</p></body></html>
