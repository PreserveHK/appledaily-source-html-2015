Soon after the battle, Napoleon entered the Duchy of Weimar.<br>Napoleon was furious with the absence of the Grand Duke of Weimar, who remained with his regiment on the side of the Prussian foe. Storming into the Ducal Palace, the French Emperor demanded,  "Where is the Duke? " The duchess replied with composure,  "At the post where duty calls him. " Napoleon thundered out in a rage, but returned the following day when his anger had subsided. The Duchess explained to him that there was little choice for her husband but to remain with the Prussian regiment until he was honourably released from his duty by the Prussian king.<br>Pacified by the Duchers' frank explanation of her husband's situation, Napoleon replied,  "You have saved your husband. I pardon him, but only for your sake."<br>一八零六年耶拿一役，拿破崙大敗普魯士。戰後不久，這個法國國王就進佔威瑪大公領地。<br>當時威瑪大公還在普魯士軍中，率領軍團，和法軍對敵。拿破崙見他不在，大發雷霆，闖進大公府，喝問：「公爵哪裏去了？」大公夫人不慌不忙，回答說：「他在職責所在的地方。」拿破崙憤然拂袖而去。第二天，他怒氣稍消，回到大公府，大公夫人跟他解釋說，她丈夫不能不留在普魯士軍團之中，直到普魯士國王解除他職務，才能光榮引身而退。<br>拿破崙見她這樣坦誠解釋丈夫的處境，怒氣盡消，回答說：「你救了尊夫，不是你，我不會饒他。」</p></body></html>
