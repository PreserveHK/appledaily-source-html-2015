While wrestling with the difficulties of running a state, he always found time to help the needy.<br>A man once wrote to ask for Reagan's suit to wear at his wedding: he could not afford one and he thought he and Reagan were the same size. Reagan sent the suit. Two sisters wrote to ask for a rocking chair for their mentally disabled brother. Reagan sent the man his own rocking chair.<br>And when an American soldier in Vietnam asked Reagan in a letter to call his wife to pass on his love in case she did not receive the card he had sent her, Reagan even surpassed the favour and had a dozen roses delivered to the woman at her home.<br>朗奴．列根一九八一年出任美國總統之前，一九六七至七五年曾任加利福尼亞州長。處理一州事務，固然吃力，但列根還會撥冗照顧貧者。<br>有個男人致函列根，說想要他那套西裝，穿着舉行婚禮：他自己買不起一套，並認為列根的身材和他相同。列根就把西裝寄去。有兩姊妹致函列根，說想要一張搖椅，給她們一個弱智的兄弟。列根就把自己坐的搖椅送出。<br>又有一個在越南的美國士兵致函列根，說給妻子寄了示愛卡，但怕寄失了，請列根打電話給他妻子，代表心意。列根所為，甚至超乎所請：他把十二朵玫瑰花送到那婦人家裏。<br>﹝更正﹞昨日拙欄末句「均亦非吾曹所能也」之亦字宜刪去。僕校閱失慎，謹此致歉。</p></body></html>
