Finding every attempt ineffectual, he put on his uniform of a national guard, and thus deceived his father, by stating that he was called on duty to mount guard in the city, instead of which he sallied forth from the barrier, and at about six in the evening, was brought home in a coach, mortally wounded. He expired a few days after, uniformly comforting his distracted parent, by stating that although he had disobeyed him, as a son, he had nevertheless yielded to the calls of his country, and that he died satisfied with the assurance of at least having killed one Prussian.<br><em> 威廉．愛爾蘭《最近七年的法國》一書談到一八一五年滑鐵盧戰役剛結束後在巴黎所見：</em> <br>正對着我住所的一家，戶主是一位卡雷先生，有個十八歲的獨子。這少年請求父親准許他去跟已臨城下的敵軍一戰，但多次請求都不成功，於是穿上國民兵制服，說奉命守衞巴黎，騙過父親。而他不是簡單守衞，還走出守衞的屏障，襲擊敵軍。黃昏六時左右，一輛馬車送他回家。他身受重傷，不可救藥，幾天之後去世，去世前不斷安慰傷心欲絕的父親，說雖然沒有盡孝，聽父親的話，卻已盡忠，聽從國家的呼喚。他又說死也無憾，因為知道自己至少殺了一個普魯士人。</p></body></html>
