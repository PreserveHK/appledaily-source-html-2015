After the bottle had circulated freely, an English trooper rose and said,  "Gentlemen, when I am in my cups, and the generous wine begins to warm my blood, I have an absurd custom of railing against the Scotch. I hope no gentleman in the company, knowing my weakness, will take it amiss."<br>When he sat down, a Highland chief, Sir Robert Blackie, presenting a front like an old battle-worn tower, quietly rose and with the utmost simplicity and good nature remarked:  "Gentlemen, I, when I am in my cups, and the generous wine begins to warm my blood, if I hear a man rail against the Scotch, have an absurd custom of kicking him at once out of the company. I hope no gentleman in the company, knowing my weakness, will take it amiss."<br>The English trooper did not on that occasion suffer himself to follow his usual custom.<br>詹姆斯一世*登上英格蘭王位之後，蘇格蘭士紳在倫敦也漸覺賓至如歸。有一天，哈伍德勳爵設晚宴，酒過三巡，一個英格蘭騎兵站起來說：「各位，我喝了幾杯美酒之後，往往就發酒興，會罵蘇格蘭人。在座各位，請多多包涵我這種不能自已的古怪行為。」<br>蘇格蘭一個族長羅勃特．布萊基待他坐下，靜靜的站起來，樣子有如一座久經戰火的鐵塔。他態度友善，簡簡單單的說：「各位，我喝了幾杯美酒之後，往往就發酒興，聽見蘇格蘭人給詈罵，會馬上把罵人者一腳踢走，在座各位，請多多包涵我這種不能自已的古怪行為。」<br>那英格蘭騎兵這一次沒有按習慣行事。<br>*詹姆斯一世同時也是蘇格蘭王。</p></body></html>
