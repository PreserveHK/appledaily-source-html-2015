Doubt as to whether Philip was really his father later allowed Alexander to declare that he was a god and the son of Juipter. Alexander's mother, Olympias, preferred to leave the matter obscure. When news was brought to her of Alexander's claim to divine paternity, she said, "Please -- I don't want to get into any trouble with Juno."①<br>*　　　　*　　　　*<br>After Alexander had conquered Egypt, the Persian king, Darius, sent a letter offering generous terms for peace and future friendship: 10,000 talents②to be paid in ransom for Persian prisoners, all the countries west of the Euphrates to be ceded to Alexander, and Darius's daughter to be given to him in marriage. Alexander consulted his friends about how he should respond. His general Parmenion said,  "If I were Alexander, I would accept these offers."<br>"So would I," said Alexander,  "if I were Parmenion."<br>世人對亞歷山大大帝的降生，頗多傳說，或說菲力浦未必真是他生父，因此，亞歷山大後來自稱為神，為天帝朱庇特的兒子。亞歷山大的母親奧林匹亞絲對兒子的身世，一向不加說明，但聽到他認天帝作生父的消息，就說：「請仔細──我不想觸怒天后朱諾。」①<br>*　　　　*　　　　*<br>亞歷山大征服埃及之後，波斯王大流士奉書求和，並請結為與國，提出的條件十分慷慨，願以一萬塔蘭特②贖回波斯戰俘，以幼發拉底河以西諸國割讓，並以女兒許配亞歷山大。亞歷山大問同行諸友應怎樣回答。帕曼紐將軍說：「我是亞歷山大，就會答應。」<br>亞歷山大說：「我是帕曼紐，也會答應。」<br>①朱諾以善妒著名。<br>②塔蘭特是古希臘等地的貨幣。</p></body></html>
