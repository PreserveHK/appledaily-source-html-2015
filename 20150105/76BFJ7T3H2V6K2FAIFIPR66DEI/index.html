He set spurs to his horse, and was soon galloping away, with the enemy after him.<br>After riding some distance, he came upon an officer on foot, and allowed him to get on the horse. When the officer had mounted the horse straightway bolted, leaving Smith-Dorrien behind to the mercy of the fast approaching enemy. Nothing daunted, he sprinted ahead, and it was not in vain that he had taken many prizes in his younger days for running. He kept ahead for a couple of miles, with the Zulus, who were known to be swift runners, close upon his heels, until at last he spurted into camp and safety.<br>一八七九年祖魯戰爭期間，英國軍官史密斯─多賴因有一天獨自外出，察看環境，走到軍營幾公里之外，突然遭一群祖魯人襲擊，連忙策馬飛奔，祖魯人窮追不捨。<br>路上，史密斯─多賴因碰到一個徒步的軍官，允許那軍官上馬，不料這軍官一上馬，那匹馬就跑了，剩下史密斯─多賴因一人，而祖魯人正迅速迫近。他十分鎮定，拔足全力奔跑。他少時憑賽跑屢次獲獎，可不是鬧着玩的。祖魯人以快跑知名，一直緊隨他身後，但史密斯─多賴因跑了幾英里，始終沒被追上，終於回到軍營，逃過一劫。</p></body></html>
