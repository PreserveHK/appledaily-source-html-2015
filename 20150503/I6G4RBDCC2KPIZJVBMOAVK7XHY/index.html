In order to withstand the cavalry charges of the Mamelukes from any direction, he placed his troops in square divisions.<br>The Battle of the Pyramids saw a curious encounter. As a white-bearded Mameluke rode his horse tauntingly in front of a French square, a lieutenant rode out to accept the challenge. Like two medieval knights on a field of honour, they faced each other and closed the distance. The lieutenant's first pistol shot dismounted the Mameluke. Crawling on his hands and knees, the Mameluke used his scimitar to sever the feet of the lieutenant's horse. The fight continued on the ground until the Frenchman's sabre struck the Mameluke's head, disabling him. Soldiers raced out of the French square to finish off the Mameluke with their rifle butts.<br>一七九八年法軍犯埃及。拿破崙知道，埃及軍戰場上唯一還算厲害的，是騎兵。他於是把軍隊排成多個方陣，這樣，瑪穆魯克人的騎兵無論從那一方來襲，法軍都可以抵禦。<br>金字塔之役，有一場古怪的衝突：一個白鬍子的瑪穆魯克人，騎着馬，在法軍方陣之前，耀武揚威。法軍一個中尉見他搦戰，策馬出陣，兩人就像中世紀武士為榮譽而戰一樣，相向走近。那中尉用手槍，一開火，就把那瑪穆魯克人射下馬來；那瑪穆魯克人伏地向前爬，用彎刀砍斷那中尉坐騎的腳。兩人在地上繼續格鬥。最後，那中尉的軍刀砍中那瑪穆魯克人的頭顱，使他不能再戰。法軍方陣裏幾個士兵走出來，用來福槍柄結果了那瑪穆魯克人的性命。</p></body></html>
