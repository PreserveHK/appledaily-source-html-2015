The death of his friend drove him to despair, and his grief was so great that it became a subject of conversation to the whole army. At last it reached the ears of Napoleon, who paid a personal visit to the mourner. Napoleon is said to have shed tears on the occasion, and endeavoured in vain to console him.<br>A few days after this interview, the young man distinguished himself by a desperate intrepidity, which evinced his desire to follow his friend. Napoleon, fearful of the example, observed,  "As for this young xxxx, he is a brave youth, but I should have ordered him to be shot had that conduct continued."<br>一七九九年，法軍遠征埃及期間，勇敢的卡法雷利將軍有一次和一個年輕摯友並肩作戰，在他眼前倒地不起。卡法雷利之死，令那年輕人氣喪志頹，其悲痛之深，軍中眾口一談，談言終於傳到拿破崙耳中。拿破崙親自探訪這個哀傷的年輕人，據說還當場灑淚，只是怎樣都不能排解那年輕人的傷痛。<br>那年輕人和拿破崙見面之後，過了幾天，表現出不惜一死之勇，為人矚目。他顯然是想追隨摯友於地下。拿破崙擔心他的行為成為軍中榜樣，說道：「這個年輕的×××，是個勇敢傢伙，但他繼續這樣做，我會下令把他槍決。」</p></body></html>
