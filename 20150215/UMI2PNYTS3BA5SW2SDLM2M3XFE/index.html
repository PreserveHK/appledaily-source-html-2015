On  18 October, he decided to retreat, but the cold weather descended earlier than usual and caught the French in its grip, killing first the horses and later the famished troops.<br>In one of the battles during the retreat, Marshal Ney, who commanded the rear guard, found his little band of  6,000 opposed to the Russian Field-Marshal Kutusoff's whole army of  80,000. Kutusoff sent a flag of truce, and summoned him to surrender. Ney replied, "A French marshal never surrenders."<br>During the fight that ensued, Ney himself several times charged at the  80,000 Russians with  2,000 men. Though obliged to fall back, he succeeded in holding out till dark, under cover of which he effected his escape by a circuitous route.<br>一八一二年，拿破崙入侵俄國，轉戰十二星期，進佔莫斯科，卻發覺莫斯科處處着火。十月十八日，他決定撤退，但寒冬降臨早於平常，蹂躪法軍，最初是馬匹紛紛冷死，然後是饑腸轆轆的將士。<br>法軍由內伊元帥負責斷後。在一場戰役之中，他手下只有六千人，卻要對抗俄國陸軍元帥庫圖索夫的八萬大軍。庫圖索夫先遣人持着休戰旗，叫內伊投降。內伊回答：「法國沒有投降的元帥。」<br>隨後，兩軍交鋒，內伊幾次親率二千人，進擊八萬俄軍，雖然被迫退卻，但一直抵抗到黑夜。他就在黑夜掩護之下，繞道逃脫。</p></body></html>
