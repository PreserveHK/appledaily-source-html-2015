It is said that, when Watt was a child, his aunt, Mrs Muirhead, sitting with him one evening at the tea-table, said,  "James, I never saw such an idle boy! Take a book or employ yourself usefully. For the last half-hour you have not spoken a word, but taken off the lid of that kettle and put it on again, holding now a cup and now a silver spoon over the steam, while it rises from the spout, and counting the drops of water." It appears that when thus blamed he was investigating the condensation of steam.<br>蘇格蘭工程師詹姆斯．瓦特發明的瓦特蒸汽機，是十八世紀工業革命不可或缺的科技產品，而其初步構思，來自瓦特對水壺之觀察。據說，瓦特小時，姑母繆爾黑德太太有一晚和他一起，坐在茶几前，對他說：「詹姆斯，我從沒見過像你這麼懶惰的孩子。拿本書讀讀，或做些有意思的事吧。這半個鐘頭，你一言不發，把水壺蓋拿起又放下，見水壺嘴冒出蒸汽，就拿起茶杯、銀匙，反覆置於蒸汽之上，點算凝結的水點。」看來，瓦特受責的時候，正在研究水蒸汽怎樣凝結。</p></body></html>
