Napoleon listened to them for several minutes with complacency, until wearied by their importunity, he made the following tart reply:  "I am by no means a man of talent or genius, gentlemen, neither do I consider myself altogether a fool; yet I feel well convinced that I am between two!"<br>✽　　✽　　✽<br>One day, the Emperor Napoleon, seeing near him one of those beings who know not a posture sufficiently humble, by which they suppose they can obtain some favours, said to those who surrounded him:  "I know not how it happens that, in order to understand this man, who is eight inches taller than myself, I am obliged to stoop every time that I speak to him."<br>拿破崙任砲兵團上校時，有一次坐在兩個普魯士軍官之間。當時拿破崙的才華已惹人注目，那兩個軍官都希望他賜教。拿破崙聽他們說了幾分鐘，最初也頗為自得，但終於給他們央求得不耐煩，回答也不留情面：「兩位，我不是天才，但也不認為自己是蠢材。我只是深深感到，有兩個蠢材在我兩邊而已。」<br>✽　　✽　　✽<br>有一次，拿破崙國王看見身旁有一個人，是那種脅肩媚貴長恐不足的人。拿破崙對左右說：「我不知道為什麼會這樣。這個人比我高八英寸，但是，要弄清楚他說什麼，我每次都得俯身跟他說話。」</p></body></html>
